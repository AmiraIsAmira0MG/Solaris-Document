### TheRevisitor caught cheating
As a side note, TheRevisitor claims that "Eon is unsafe." This claim is false. He has been part of the Eon community for about a year and has played on multiple accounts, even sharing videos of himself playing. It makes no sense to call it a virus when he actively uses it. His statement appears to be an attempt to slander the brand.
