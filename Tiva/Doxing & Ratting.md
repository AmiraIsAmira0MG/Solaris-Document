### Doxxing with IRL Consequences
Tiva **doxxed Egator06** and sent pizza to his home without consent. They intentionally added every topping to maximize the price and make it disgusting and inedible ensuring Egator06 couldn’t even eat it if he wanted to. He was then forced to pay the delivery driver. Egator06 is still a developer, raising concerns that he may feel unsafe or be staying involved against his will.
