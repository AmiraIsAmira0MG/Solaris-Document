### Doxxing with IRL Consequences
Tiva **doxxed Egator06** and sent pizza to his home without consent. They intentionally added every topping to maximize the price and make it disgusting and inedible ensuring Egator06 couldn’t even eat it if he wanted to. He was then forced to pay the delivery driver. Egator06 is still a developer, raising concerns that he may feel unsafe or be staying involved against his will.

### Showing Bias and Protected Staff who Violated Privacy

### Egator6 was punished for doing the same thing Wesley did

When Egator6 responded by doing something similar with Wesley and Tiva’s faces, he was kicked, while Wesley faced no consequences—highlighting clear favoritism and a double standard in staff enforcement.

### Egator admitting to Tiva sending a previous friend's complete doxx in the Solaris Group Chats.
This isnt an acceptable action for a human to take, it is extremely disrespectful and can cause high amounts of distress and panic.
