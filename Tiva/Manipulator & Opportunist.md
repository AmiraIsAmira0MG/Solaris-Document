## Kristopher explained that Tiva avoids taking responsibility and manipulates others
When Tiva joined Twin1's project, he became hostile if people didn’t obey him. He pressured several individuals and never addressed issues directly. Instead of speaking one-on-one, he brought others into arguments including once bringing a full-grown adult to confront Kristopher, who was only 14.

### Tiva spread lies about Delayed in an effort to get them removed
He falsely labeled Delayed as a 'D1 skid' and 'beggar,' accused them of stealing from Sketchfab, and claimed they only learned from Wesley. These are baseless and appear to be attempts to sabotage and cause internal conflict.

### Tiva deflected blame in a doxxing incident

When asked if he doxxed a user named Delayed, Tiva denied it and immediately shifted suspicion to someone else (Rio), without evidence. Instead of expressing concern, he claimed Rio was just "pissed" about losing members to his server.
